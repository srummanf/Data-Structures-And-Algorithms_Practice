### Introduction to System Design

- System Design focuses on engineering design patterns for building large-scale distributed systems.
- A practical example in the course is designing and coding a live streaming video application.

### Understanding Large Scale Distributed Systems

- **Large-Scale Systems**: These systems handle substantial data volumes, cater to many users, and have frequent updates. Examples include social media platforms, search engines, and streaming services.
- **Distributed Systems**: Servers are spread across multiple locations to improve performance and provide fault tolerance. For instance, Google Maps processes vast data amounts and needs to be both fast and reliable.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Key considerations in distributed systems include scalability (handling increasing loads) and reliability (ensuring consistent performance).

### Design Patterns in System Design

- **Design Patterns**: These are established solutions to common problems in software design. They help build systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Model**: In this model, events from a publisher (e.g., a social media post) are efficiently distributed to many subscribers. This pattern helps manage real-time data updates and notifications.
- **Other Patterns**: Includes load balancing, caching, sharding, and microservices, each addressing specific system requirements and challenges.

### Use Case and Class Diagrams

- **Use Case Diagrams**: These diagrams capture user interactions and system functionality. They help in understanding and documenting user requirements.
- **Class Diagrams**: These diagrams define the system's objects, their attributes, methods, and relationships. They are crucial for object-oriented design.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: These diagrams illustrate the order of interactions and actions in the system. They help in visualizing the flow of processes and data.

### Designing a Live Streaming Video System

- **Core Features**: The system must play videos, allow users to resume playback, and adjust video quality based on network conditions.
- **Concurrency and Fault Tolerance**: The system must handle multiple users concurrently and be resilient to failures.
- **User Experience**: Considerations include minimizing buffering, optimizing memory usage, and ensuring smooth playback.

### Low-Level Design Considerations

- **Video Quality Management**: The system should adapt video quality based on the user's device and network conditions.
- **Playback Position Storage**: Efficiently storing and retrieving playback positions for resuming videos.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing effective caching to reduce load times and improve performance.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Managing simultaneous user requests and ensuring data consistency.
- **Latency and Throughput**: Optimizing for low latency (quick response times) and high throughput (handling many requests).

### User Requirements and Design

1. **Identifying User Requirements**: Understanding what users need from the system.
2. **Translating Requirements into Use Cases**: Creating use cases to document and visualize these requirements.
3. **Creating Class Diagrams**: Designing the system's objects, attributes, methods, and relationships.
4. **Developing Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrating the flow of interactions and processes within the system.

### System Requirements

- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing loads by adding more resources.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the system performs consistently and is resilient to failures.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing for performance and resource utilization.

### Design and Implementation Steps

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Gather and analyze user requirements.
2. **System Design**: Create architectural diagrams and design documents.
3. **Implementation**: Develop the system based on the design.
4. **Testing**: Perform testing to ensure the system meets requirements.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the system to the production environment.
6. **Maintenance**: Continuously monitor and maintain the system.
