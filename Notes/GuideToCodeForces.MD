### 1. **Create an Account**

- If you haven't already, create an account on Codeforces. This will allow you to participate in contests, track your progress, and engage with the community.

### 2. **Understand the Platform**

- Explore the platform to familiarize yourself with the different sections like `Contests`, `Problemset`, `Gym`, `Groups`, and `Blogs`. Each has its own purpose:
  - **Contests**: Regular competitions where you solve problems under time constraints.
  - **Problemset**: A collection of problems that you can solve at any time.
  - **Gym**: Virtual contests where you can practice previous contests or training rounds.
  - **Blogs**: Posts by users that often contain tips, tutorials, and discussions.

### 3. **Start with Practice Problems**

- Go to the `Problemset` and start solving problems. You can sort by difficulty (starting with easier problems) or by tags (e.g., sorting, dynamic programming, etc.).
- As a beginner, start with problems rated below 1200 and gradually move up as you become more comfortable.

### 4. **Participate in Div 3 and Div 4 Contests**

- Codeforces contests are divided into divisions:
  - **Div 3 & 4** are beginner-friendly and a great starting point.
  - **Div 2** is intermediate, suitable as you gain more experience.
  - **Div 1** is for advanced users.
- These contests usually take place 1-2 times a week. Check the `Contests` section for the schedule.

### 5. **Learn From Solutions**

- After each contest, read editorials and look at others' solutions to understand different approaches. This helps in learning new techniques and improving problem-solving skills.

### 6. **Use Virtual Contests**

- If you miss a live contest, you can participate in it later as a virtual contest. This simulates the contest environment and allows you to practice under time constraints.

### 7. **Engage with the Community**

- Follow blogs, participate in discussions, and learn from others in the community. This will help you stay motivated and learn new strategies.

### 8. **Consistent Practice**

- Set a regular schedule for practice. Even 1-2 hours daily can make a significant difference over time.

### 9. **Track Your Progress**

- Use your Codeforces rating and problem-solving history to track your progress. Focus on gradual improvement.

### **Contests Timing**

- Codeforces contests are usually held in the evening (Moscow Time), typically on weekdays like Tuesday or Thursday, but this can vary. The contests are announced a few days in advance, so keep an eye on the `Contests` page or join the Codeforces Telegram channel for updates.

### **Conclusion**

- Start with easier problems, gradually increase difficulty, and regularly participate in contests. The key is consistent practice and learning from mistakes. With time and effort, you'll see significant improvement in your competitive programming skills.
