In my opinion, it is a topic of [current relevance/sensitivity/controversy/interest].

I believe that [initial balanced opinion on the topic].

Now, I invite all of you to participate in the discussion."
```

## Tips for Different Scenarios

| Scenario            | Approach                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Familiar Topic      | Confidently state your understanding and initial viewpoint     |
| Unfamiliar Topic    | Focus on the topic's relevance and invite others' views        |
| Controversial Topic | Acknowledge multiple perspectives and aim for a balanced start |

## Example: Handling a Comparative Topic

Topic: "Are Women Better Managers than Men?"

Approach:

- Avoid direct comparisons
- Emphasize equality and individual capabilities
- Highlight the importance of skills over gender

Sample Statement:

```
"I believe that management capabilities are not gender-specific. Both women and men can be excellent managers given the right skills, experience, and personality traits. It's more productive to focus on what makes a good manager in general, rather than comparing genders."
```

## Key Points to Remember

- **Confidence**: Speak clearly and confidently, even if you're unsure about the topic
- **Neutrality**: Start with a balanced view to encourage diverse opinions
- **Inclusivity**: Use language that invites everyone to participate
- **Relevance**: Connect the topic to current trends or issues when possible
- **Brevity**: Keep your opening concise to allow time for others

By following these guidelines, you can make a strong first impression and set a positive tone for the entire Group Discussion.
