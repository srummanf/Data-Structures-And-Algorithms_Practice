Test Type - 90 mins - 3 questions- (Exp : 1 easy array, 1 med array, 1 hard graph)--Hackerrank

Certainly! Here are 10 questions similar to Leetcode 385 "Mini Parser". These questions generally involve parsing strings, implementing data structures, or dealing with nested structures.

1. **Leetcode 394: Decode String**

   - Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times.
2. **Leetcode 636: Exclusive Time of Functions**

   - Given the running logs of `n` functions, return the exclusive time of these functions. Logs are sorted by timestamps and you need to account for nested function calls.
3. **Leetcode 772: Basic Calculator III**

   - Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string which may contain parentheses, integers, and operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
4. **Leetcode 726: Number of Atoms**

   - Given a chemical formula (represented by a string), return the count of each atom. An atomic element always starts with an uppercase character followed by zero or more lowercase letters, e.g., "H", "O", "Mg", etc.
5. **Leetcode 331: Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree**

   - One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. Given a string of comma-separated values representing a pre-order serialization of a binary tree, verify if it is a correct serialization.
6. **Leetcode 224: Basic Calculator**

   - Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string which contains only non-negative integers, `+`, `-` operators, and parentheses `(`, `)`.
7. **Leetcode 150: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**

   - Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and each operand may be an integer or another expression.
8. **Leetcode 394: Decode String**

   - Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times.
9. **Leetcode 394: Decode String**

   - Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times.
10. **Leetcode 227: Basic Calculator II**

    - Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string. The expression string contains only non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators, and empty spaces. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

These questions all involve parsing strings and dealing with nested structures or evaluating expressions, making them similar in nature to the Mini Parser problem. They will help you practice and improve your string parsing and manipulation skills in a variety of contexts.
