### Types of DP Problem : *https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1050391/Must-do-Dynamic-programming-Problems-Category-wise*

Understanding when to use Dynamic Programming (DP) and whether to use 1D, 2D, or 3D DP depends on the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

### When to Use Dynamic Programming (DP):

1. **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be broken down into smaller overlapping subproblems where the optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems recur multiple times in the computation, and memoization (storing results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations) or tabulation (building solutions bottom-up) can be applied.
3. **Recursive Solution with Overlapping Calls**: If a recursive solution exists that has repeated calls for the same inputs, DP can often be used to optimize by storing results of subproblems.

### Choosing Between 1D, 2D, or 3D DP:

1. **1D DP**:

   - **Single Sequence**: Use 1D DP when the problem involves optimizing a single sequence or array, where each state in the DP array represents the solution up to that point.
   - **Examples**: Fibonacci sequence, Maximum subarray sum, Longest increasing subsequence.
2. **2D DP**:

   - **Two Variables or Sequences**: Use 2D DP when the problem involves optimizing over two dimensions or sequences, where each state in the DP table depends on two variables or sequences.
   - **Examples**: Matrix DP problems (e.g., minimum path sum in a grid), String manipulation (e.g., longest common subsequence).
3. **3D DP**:

   - **Three Variables or Sequences**: Use 3D DP when the problem involves optimizing over three dimensions or sequences.
   - **Examples**: Cubic DP problems (e.g., painting a grid with minimum cost, where each cell has multiple color choices), Time-series DP (e.g., stock trading problems involving buying, selling, and cooldown periods).

### Steps to Decide:

1. **Understand Problem Structure**: Identify if the problem can be divided into smaller subproblems that overlap in a way that allows for efficient computation using DP.
2. **Define State**: Determine what each state in your DP table represents. This could be a position in an array, a combination of indices, or any other relevant state based on the problem requirements.
3. **Transition Between States**: Define how you transition from one state to another. This involves understanding how the optimal solution at a current state depends on previously computed states.
4. **Space Complexity Consideration**: While higher-dimensional DP tables can capture more complex relationships, they also increase space complexity. Ensure the problem justifies the use of higher-dimensional tables based on the input size and constraints.

### Example Thought Process:

- **Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence.

  - **Decision**: Since the problem involves optimizing a single sequence (the array) and has overlapping subproblems (different starting points), a 1D DP array can be used. Each entry in the DP array can store the maximum alternating sum ending at that index.
- **Problem**: Given a grid with costs associated with each cell, find the minimum cost path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, allowing only rightward and downward movements.

  - **Decision**: This problem involves optimizing over two dimensions (rows and columns of the grid). Hence, a 2D DP table can be used, where each cell in the DP table represents the minimum cost to reach that cell.

### Conclusion:

Choosing the right type of Dynamic Programming approach (1D, 2D, or 3D) depends on understanding the problem structure, identifying overlapping subproblems, and defining states and transitions appropriately. Practice and familiarity with different types of DP problems will improve your ability to recognize when and how to apply DP effectively.
