#### How to recognise

* Things we iterate over sequentially
* Contiguous sequence of elements - Strings, arrays, linked list
* Dealing with min, max, longest, shortest, contain

#### Question Variants

* Fixed Length - Max Sum Subarray of size k
* Dynamic Variant - Smallest Sum >= Some value S
* Dynamic Variant with Auxilliary Data Structure(HashMap, HashSet) - Longest Substring with no more k distint characters
* String Permutation

Commonalities - Everything grouped sequentially, Longest/Smallest/Contains/Max/Min
