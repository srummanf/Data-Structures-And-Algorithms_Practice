1. Question: Why are you interested in working for AstraZeneca?

Answer: I'm drawn to AstraZeneca's mission of using science and technology to develop life-changing medicines. The company's focus on innovation in biopharmaceuticals aligns with my passion for leveraging technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. Additionally, AstraZeneca's commitment to being a Great Place to Work resonates with me, as I believe a supportive work environment fosters creativity and productivity.

2. Question: How do you stay updated with the latest trends in technology?

Answer: I stay current with technology trends through various methods. I regularly follow tech blogs and news sites, participate in online forums, and attend webinars on emerging technologies. I'm also part of local tech meetup groups where we discuss new developments. Additionally, I engage in personal projects and online courses to gain hands-on experience with new tools and frameworks.

3. Question: Can you describe a complex problem you've solved and how you approached it?

Answer: In my final year project, we faced a challenge in optimizing a large dataset for quick queries. I approached this by first thoroughly analyzing the data structure and query patterns. Then, I researched various indexing techniques and implemented a combination of B-tree and hash indexing. This solution significantly reduced query times by 70%. The process involved breaking down the problem, researching potential solutions, implementing the most promising approach, and iteratively refining it based on performance metrics.

4. Question: How do you handle working in a team with diverse skill sets?

Answer: I believe diverse teams bring varied perspectives that lead to more innovative solutions. In team settings, I start by understanding each member's strengths and expertise. I actively listen to everyone's ideas and try to bridge communication gaps between technical and non-technical team members. I'm always eager to learn from others and share my knowledge where it's valuable. In group projects, I've often taken on the role of coordinating different aspects of the work to ensure we leverage each member's skills effectively.

5. Question: How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects?

Answer: When juggling multiple projects, I first assess the urgency and importance of each task. I use tools like Trello or Asana to organize and visualize my workload. I communicate regularly with team members and stakeholders to ensure alignment on priorities. I also break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks with specific deadlines. This approach helps me stay focused and ensures steady progress across all projects.

6. Question: How would you contribute to creating a collaborative environment within the team?

Answer: To foster collaboration, I'd start by being approachable and open to ideas from all team members. I believe in regular team meetings where everyone can share updates and challenges. I'd encourage the use of collaborative tools for real-time communication and document sharing. Additionally, I'd propose pair programming sessions or code reviews to share knowledge and improve code quality. Creating a positive atmosphere where people feel comfortable sharing ideas and asking for help is crucial for effective collaboration.

7. Question: Can you give an example of how you've applied object-oriented programming concepts in a project?

Answer: In a recent project, I developed a library management system using Java. I applied OOP concepts by creating classes like 'Book', 'User', and 'Library'. The 'Book' class had properties like title, author, and ISBN, and methods for checking out and returning. The 'User' class managed borrower information and borrowing history. The 'Library' class acted as a controller, managing the interactions between books and users. This structure allowed for easy maintenance and scalability of the system.

8. Question: How do you ensure the quality of your code?

Answer: To ensure code quality, I follow several practices. First, I adhere to coding standards and best practices specific to the language I'm using. I write clean, well-documented code with meaningful variable and function names. I regularly use code linting tools to catch potential issues early. I also believe in the importance of unit testing and try to achieve high test coverage. Additionally, I participate in code reviews, both as a reviewer and reviewee, which helps in identifying improvements and sharing knowledge within the team.

Remember to prepare specific examples from your own experience for these questions. Also, be ready to discuss any projects or achievements mentioned in your resume, especially those related to the key areas mentioned in the job description, such as full-stack development, cloud technologies, and statistical modeling.
