### Types of DP Problem : *https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1050391/Must-do-Dynamic-programming-Problems-Category-wise*

Understanding when to use Dynamic Programming (DP) and whether to use 1D, 2D, or 3D DP depends on the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

### When to Use Dynamic Programming (DP):

1. **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be broken down into smaller overlapping subproblems where the optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems recur multiple times in the computation, and memoization (storing results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations) or tabulation (building solutions bottom-up) can be applied.
3. **Recursive Solution with Overlapping Calls**: If a recursive solution exists that has repeated calls for the same inputs, DP can often be used to optimize by storing results of subproblems.

### Choosing Between 1D, 2D, or 3D DP:

1. **1D DP**:

   - **Single Sequence**: Use 1D DP when the problem involves optimizing a single sequence or array, where each state in the DP array represents the solution up to that point.
   - **Examples**: Fibonacci sequence, Maximum subarray sum, Longest increasing subsequence.
2. **2D DP**:

   - **Two Variables or Sequences**: Use 2D DP when the problem involves optimizing over two dimensions or sequences, where each state in the DP table depends on two variables or sequences.
   - **Examples**: Matrix DP problems (e.g., minimum path sum in a grid), String manipulation (e.g., longest common subsequence).
3. **3D DP**:

   - **Three Variables or Sequences**: Use 3D DP when the problem involves optimizing over three dimensions or sequences.
   - **Examples**: Cubic DP problems (e.g., painting a grid with minimum cost, where each cell has multiple color choices), Time-series DP (e.g., stock trading problems involving buying, selling, and cooldown periods).

### Steps to Decide:

1. **Understand Problem Structure**: Identify if the problem can be divided into smaller subproblems that overlap in a way that allows for efficient computation using DP.
2. **Define State**: Determine what each state in your DP table represents. This could be a position in an array, a combination of indices, or any other relevant state based on the problem requirements.
3. **Transition Between States**: Define how you transition from one state to another. This involves understanding how the optimal solution at a current state depends on previously computed states.
4. **Space Complexity Consideration**: While higher-dimensional DP tables can capture more complex relationships, they also increase space complexity. Ensure the problem justifies the use of higher-dimensional tables based on the input size and constraints.

### Example Thought Process:

- **Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence.

  - **Decision**: Since the problem involves optimizing a single sequence (the array) and has overlapping subproblems (different starting points), a 1D DP array can be used. Each entry in the DP array can store the maximum alternating sum ending at that index.
- **Problem**: Given a grid with costs associated with each cell, find the minimum cost path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, allowing only rightward and downward movements.

  - **Decision**: This problem involves optimizing over two dimensions (rows and columns of the grid). Hence, a 2D DP table can be used, where each cell in the DP table represents the minimum cost to reach that cell.

### Conclusion:

Choosing the right type of Dynamic Programming approach (1D, 2D, or 3D) depends on understanding the problem structure, identifying overlapping subproblems, and defining states and transitions appropriately. Practice and familiarity with different types of DP problems will improve your ability to recognize when and how to apply DP effectively.

# Building Intuition for DP

Practicing dynamic programming (DP) questions effectively requires a structured approach to build intuition and problem-solving skills. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you practice and improve:

### 1. **Understand the Problem**:

   Before jumping into a solution, **spend time understanding the problem** and its constraints. Carefully think about:

- What are you trying to compute?
- How is the result related to smaller subproblems?
- Can you recognize any overlapping subproblems or repeated calculations?

### 2. **Start with Classic DP Problems**:

   Begin by practicing classical and foundational DP problems to grasp different categories of DP:

- **0/1 Knapsack**: Learn about using DP in knapsack-type problems.
- **Fibonacci Numbers**: A simple DP problem to understand memoization or tabulation.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** and **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Good for learning multi-dimensional DP.
- **Coin Change Problem**: Helps with the "combinations" style of problems.

   These problems build the foundation for advanced DP techniques.

### 3. **Identify Problem Patterns**:

- **Optimization Problems**: Problems where you're asked to find the minimum or maximum value (e.g., shortest path, maximum profit, etc.).
- **Count-Based Problems**: Where you need to count the number of ways to achieve a particular outcome (e.g., number of ways to make change).
- **Subsequence/Substring Problems**: Where you're finding a particular subsequence or substring in a given string (e.g., LCS, LIS, etc.).

   Recognizing these patterns helps you apply the right DP technique.

### 4. **Master Common DP Techniques**:

- **Memoization (Top-Down)**: This is a recursive approach where you solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems and store the results to avoid recomputation.
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Here, you iteratively build a table starting from the smallest subproblem up to the final solution.
- **Space Optimization**: Once you're comfortable with DP tables, try optimizing space by using only the necessary rows or columns.

### 5. **Solve Problems with Increasing Difficulty**:

   Gradually move on to problems with increasing difficulty to strengthen your understanding. Some great platforms with categorized DP problems are:

- **LeetCode**: Start with "Easy" DP problems and work your way up to "Medium" and "Hard."
- **Codeforces**: Many contests have good DP problems. Practice problems from past contests.
- **GeeksforGeeks**: Has a great collection of DP tutorials and problems.

   You can also filter problems by tags, such as "Dynamic Programming," to focus your practice.

### 6. **Develop a Framework for Solving DP Problems**:

   Follow a systematic approach when solving DP questions:

- **Define the State**: Identify what your DP array or table represents (e.g., `dp[i]` might represent the maximum sum up to index `i`).
- **Formulate the Recurrence Relation**: Think about how the solution to a subproblem is related to smaller subproblems. Write the relation mathematically.
- **Base Case**: Determine the simplest cases (e.g., `dp[0] = 1` or `dp[0][0] = 0`) and initialize your DP table/array accordingly.
- **Optimize Space/Time if Possible**: Once you get the basic DP approach, think of space or time optimizations. Can you reduce the DP table size or eliminate redundant calculations?

### 7. **Revisit Mistakes and Learn**:

   Whenever you get stuck or make mistakes, take the time to understand why. Don't just move onâ€”revisit the solution and fully understand the logic. Over time, you'll develop a better intuition for how to approach different problems.

### 8. **Track Progress**:

   Keep a log of problems you've solved, the techniques used, and the difficulties faced. This will help you identify areas where you need more practice.

### 9. **Consistent Practice**:

- **Solve Daily**: Practice DP problems regularly. This helps reinforce your understanding.
- **Focus on Weak Areas**: If you're struggling with certain patterns (e.g., multi-dimensional DP), spend more time on problems in that category.

### 10. **Learn from Others**:

   Participate in forums like **LeetCode Discuss** or **Codeforces**. When you're stuck, reading others' solutions can give new perspectives on how to approach problems.
