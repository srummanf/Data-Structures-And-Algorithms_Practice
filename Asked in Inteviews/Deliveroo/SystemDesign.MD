# How would you find the root cause of a slow API?


To diagnose and find the root cause of a slow API, you need to take a structured and systematic approach. Here’s a detailed guide on how to do it:

### 1. **Monitor and Measure Performance**

#### 1.1 Use APM Tools

- Implement Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic, Datadog, Dynatrace, or Prometheus to monitor the API’s performance.
- These tools can provide insights into response times, error rates, throughput, and resource utilization.

#### 1.2 Logging

- Ensure comprehensive logging is in place. Logs should include timestamps, request and response payloads, execution times, and error messages.
- Use structured logging and centralized logging systems (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to easily search and analyze logs.

### 2. **Analyze Metrics and Logs**

#### 2.1 Identify Slow Requests

- Look for patterns in slow requests. Determine if they occur at specific times, for specific endpoints, or for specific users.
- Identify the 95th or 99th percentile of response times to focus on the worst-performing requests.

#### 2.2 Trace Requests

- Use distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to trace the lifecycle of a request across services and components.
- Identify where the most time is being spent in the request lifecycle.

### 3. **Isolate the Bottleneck**

#### 3.1 Breakdown by Components

- **Database**: Check for slow queries, locking issues, or high latency in database access. Use query profiling tools (e.g., EXPLAIN in SQL databases) and database monitoring tools.
- **Third-Party Services**: Identify if third-party APIs or services are causing delays. Measure the latency of these external calls.
- **Network Issues**: Check for high latency or packet loss in network communication. Use network monitoring tools to analyze network performance.
- **Application Code**: Profile the application code to find inefficient algorithms, excessive loops, or blocking operations.

#### 3.2 Resource Utilization

- **CPU and Memory**: Check for high CPU or memory usage. Use tools like top, htop, or APM tools to monitor resource utilization.
- **Disk I/O**: Identify if disk read/write operations are slow. Use tools like iostat to monitor disk performance.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Look for thread contention, deadlocks, or insufficient worker threads.

### 4. **Optimization Strategies**

#### 4.1 Database Optimization

- Optimize slow queries with indexing, query rewriting, or denormalization.
- Implement caching strategies to reduce database load (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Use database connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.

#### 4.2 Code Optimization

- Profile and refactor code to eliminate performance bottlenecks.
- Use asynchronous processing for I/O-bound operations.
- Optimize algorithms and data structures for better performance.

#### 4.3 Network Optimization

- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce latency for static assets.
- Implement HTTP/2 to improve network performance.
- Optimize payload sizes by compressing data and using efficient serialization formats (e.g., JSON vs. Protocol Buffers).

### 5. **Scalability and Load Balancing**

- Ensure horizontal scaling is in place to handle increased load. Use auto-scaling groups to dynamically scale resources.
- Distribute load evenly across servers using load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB, NGINX).
- Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource distribution.

### 6. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**

- Set up continuous performance testing to catch issues early. Use tools like JMeter or Gatling for load testing.
- Continuously monitor performance metrics and logs to detect and address performance degradation promptly.
- Regularly review and optimize infrastructure and application code as usage patterns and requirements evolve.

### Example Workflow

```plaintext
1. Setup Monitoring and Logging
   - Implement APM (e.g., New Relic)
   - Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack)
   - Distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger)

2. Analyze Performance Metrics
   - Identify slow endpoints and requests
   - Trace request lifecycle

3. Isolate Bottlenecks
   - Database: Slow queries, high latency
   - Third-Party Services: External API latency
   - Network: Latency, packet loss
   - Application Code: Inefficient algorithms, blocking operations

4. Optimize
   - Database: Indexing, query optimization, caching
   - Code: Refactoring, asynchronous processing
   - Network: CDN, HTTP/2, payload compression

5. Ensure Scalability
   - Horizontal scaling, auto-scaling groups
   - Load balancing
   - Rate limiting and throttling

6. Continuous Improvement
   - Continuous performance testing
   - Regular monitoring and optimization
```

By following these steps, you can systematically diagnose and resolve the root cause of slow API performance, ensuring a scalable and responsive system.


# What are overloaded methods and overwritten methods?


Overloaded methods and overridden methods are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that relate to polymorphism and how methods can be defined in classes. Let's break down each concept with definitions, key points, and examples.

### Overloaded Methods

#### Definition

Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (i.e., different type, number, or both of parameters). Overloading is a compile-time polymorphism.

#### Key Points

- Overloaded methods must have different parameter lists.
- They can have different return types, but the return type alone is not sufficient to distinguish overloaded methods.
- They can have different access modifiers.
- Overloading happens within the same class.

#### Example

```java
class MathUtils {
    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
  
    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
  
    // Overloaded method to add two double values
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathUtils mathUtils = new MathUtils();
      
        System.out.println(mathUtils.add(2, 3));       // Calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(mathUtils.add(2, 3, 4));    // Calls add(int, int, int)
        System.out.println(mathUtils.add(2.5, 3.5));   // Calls add(double, double)
    }
}
```

### Overridden Methods

#### Definition

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Overriding is a run-time polymorphism.

#### Key Points

- Overridden methods must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass.
- The overriding method can have a different access modifier, but it cannot be more restrictive than the method in the superclass.
- The overridden method can throw fewer or more specific exceptions than the method in the superclass.
- Overriding is used to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.

#### Example

```java
class Animal {
    // Method in the superclass
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overridden method in the subclass
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound();   // Calls the overridden method in Dog class
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Overloaded Methods**: Same method name, different parameter lists, occurs in the same class. Example: `public int add(int a, int b)` and `public double add(double a, double b)`.
- **Overridden Methods**: Same method name, parameter list, and return type, occurs in superclass and subclass. Example: `public void makeSound()` in `Animal` class and `public void makeSound()` in `Dog` class.

Understanding these concepts helps in designing flexible and reusable code by leveraging polymorphism in OOP.

### 5. **Scalability and Reliability**

- **Scalability**:

  - Deploy multiple instances of each service behind the API Gateway.
  - Use auto-scaling groups to handle dynamic load.
  - Partition the database to distribute the load.
  - Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
- **Reliability**:

  - Use distributed systems and replication for high availability.
  - Implement failover mechanisms for critical services.
  - Ensure idempotent operations to handle retries gracefully.

### 6. **Security**

- Secure communication using HTTPS.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for user authentication.
- Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks.
- Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for sensitive operations.

### 7. **Continuous Improvement**

- Regularly monitor system performance and optimize bottlenecks.
- Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle peak loads.
- Update and patch services to address security vulnerabilities.

By following this design, you can build a robust, scalable, and efficient system capable of handling millions of requests in a short time while tracking results per user effectively.


# How would you verify that service has a memory leak, - Composition vs Inheritence, - Coding part : parsing logs according to get information required in the task (and computational complexity),


### How to Verify a Service Has a Memory Leak

To verify that a service has a memory leak, follow these steps:

1. **Monitoring and Profiling**:

   - Use monitoring tools to track memory usage over time (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
   - Use profiling tools to analyze memory usage (e.g., JProfiler, YourKit, VisualVM).
2. **Identify Symptoms**:

   - Gradual increase in memory usage over time without corresponding decrease.
   - Frequent garbage collection with little memory being freed.
   - OutOfMemoryError exceptions.
3. **Heap Dump Analysis**:

   - Capture heap dumps at different intervals.
   - Compare the heap dumps to identify objects that are not being freed.
   - Use tools like Eclipse MAT (Memory Analyzer Tool) to analyze heap dumps.
4. **Code Review**:

   - Look for common sources of memory leaks: unclosed resources, static collections growing indefinitely, circular references, etc.
5. **Test with Load Simulation**:

   - Simulate a load on the service and monitor memory usage.
   - Run the service under load for an extended period to observe memory behavior.
6. **Logging**:

   - Add logging to track object creation and destruction.
   - Log memory usage metrics periodically.

### Composition vs Inheritance

- **Composition**:

  - **Definition**: Building complex objects by combining simpler ones.
  - **When to Use**: Prefer composition over inheritance when:
    - The relationship is "has-a" rather than "is-a".
    - You want to change behavior at runtime.
    - You need to reduce coupling between classes.
  - **Advantages**:
    - More flexible and maintainable.
    - Promotes code reuse without the downsides of tight coupling.
    - Easier to test.
- **Inheritance**:

  - **Definition**: Deriving a new class from an existing class.
  - **When to Use**: Use inheritance when:
    - The relationship is "is-a".
    - You want to share behavior across multiple classes.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Allows for polymorphism and method overriding.
    - Can lead to cleaner and more concise code in certain scenarios.
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Can lead to tight coupling and brittle code.
    - Increases the complexity of the class hierarchy.

### Parsing Logs for Information (Coding Part)

Here’s an example of parsing logs to extract specific information. Assume we have logs in the format:

```
[INFO] 2024-07-29 12:00:00 - UserID: 123 - Action: Login
[ERROR] 2024-07-29 12:01:00 - UserID: 123 - Action: FailedLogin
[INFO] 2024-07-29 12:02:00 - UserID: 456 - Action: Logout
```

We want to parse these logs and extract the number of actions per user.

#### Code Example in Python

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

log_pattern = re.compile(r'\[(\w+)\] (\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) - UserID: (\d+) - Action: (\w+)')

def parse_logs(logs):
    user_actions = defaultdict(list)
    for log in logs:
        match = log_pattern.match(log)
        if match:
            log_level, timestamp, user_id, action = match.groups()
            user_actions[user_id].append((timestamp, action))
    return user_actions

# Sample logs
logs = [
    "[INFO] 2024-07-29 12:00:00 - UserID: 123 - Action: Login",
    "[ERROR] 2024-07-29 12:01:00 - UserID: 123 - Action: FailedLogin",
    "[INFO] 2024-07-29 12:02:00 - UserID: 456 - Action: Logout"
]

user_actions = parse_logs(logs)
for user_id, actions in user_actions.items():
    print(f"User {user_id}:")
    for timestamp, action in actions:
        print(f"  - {timestamp}: {action}")
```

#### Computational Complexity

- The time complexity of this log parsing is O(n), where n is the number of log entries.
- The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique users.
