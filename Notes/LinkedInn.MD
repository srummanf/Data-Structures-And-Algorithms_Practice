Most students struggle with DSA because they think they have weak logic.
But mostly, it’s because their approach is completely wrong.

If you want to solve problems fast and with solid accuracy,
you need to think in patterns.

- This will help you learn pattern-wise:[https://bit.ly/45qggma](https://bit.ly/45qggma)

Without patterns, you can solve every problem in an interview you’ve seen once, but once you see a new problem, you will get stuck.

That’s why I’ve put together this DSA Pattern Sheet, which helps you:
✅ identify key patterns and learn when to apply them.
✅ understand scenarios and clues that signal which approach to use.
✅ practice with 5-6 leetcode problems per pattern to solidify learning.
✅ cover 250-300 essential problems, ensuring you master every core concept.
✅ customize the sheet to track progress and adapt it to your needs.
