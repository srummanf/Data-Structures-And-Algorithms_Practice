# High-Level System Design for a Live Streaming Website

Designing a live streaming website involves multiple components that must work seamlessly to ensure a smooth user experience. Here’s a detailed high-level system design:

#### 1. **User Interaction Layer**

This is the front end of the application where users interact with the website.

- **Web Application**: Built using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Mobile Application**: Native or hybrid mobile apps for Android and iOS.

#### 2. **API Gateway**

An entry point for all client requests.

- **API Gateway**: Handles routing, rate limiting, security, and load balancing. Tools like NGINX, Kong, or AWS API Gateway are used.

#### 3. **Authentication and Authorization**

Ensures secure access to the platform.

- **Authentication Server**: Services like OAuth, JWT, or Auth0.
- **User Management**: Handles user registration, login, password management, and profile management.

#### 4. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**

Distributes video content globally to reduce latency and load times.

- **CDN Providers**: Akamai, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront.

#### 5. **Media Server**

Handles the live video streams.

- **Streaming Protocols**: RTMP for ingestion, HLS/DASH for distribution.
- **Media Server Software**: Wowza, Nginx with RTMP module, or AWS Elemental MediaLive.

#### 6. **Video Processing**

Processes the live video streams.

- **Transcoding**: Converts the live stream into various formats and resolutions.
- **Packaging**: Prepares the video for different streaming protocols (HLS, DASH).

#### 7. **Storage**

Stores the video content and user data.

- **Object Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
- **Database**: Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data, NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra) for unstructured data.

#### 8. **Microservices**

Handles various functionalities of the application.

- **User Service**: Manages user-related operations.
- **Video Service**: Manages video upload, processing, and streaming.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications for events like new live streams, comments, etc.
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks and analyzes user behavior, stream performance, etc.

#### 9. **Real-time Messaging**

Enables real-time features like live chat.

- **WebSockets**: For low-latency, real-time communication.
- **Message Brokers**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis for message queuing.

#### 10. **Monitoring and Logging**

Ensures the system is running smoothly and helps in troubleshooting.

- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Logging Tools**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk.

#### 11. **Scaling and Fault Tolerance**

Ensures the system can handle high traffic and is resilient to failures.

- **Auto-Scaling**: AWS Auto Scaling, Kubernetes.
- **Load Balancing**: AWS ELB, NGINX, HAProxy.
