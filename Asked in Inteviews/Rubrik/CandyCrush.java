/** This problem requires you to simulate the game "Candy Crush". Given a 2D grid representing a candy board of size m x n, where each cell contains an integer that represents a different type of candy, your task is to implement an algorithm that performs a series of crushing actions according to the game's rules.

The crushing rules are as follows:

When three or more candies of the same type are adjacent either vertically or horizontally, they all get crushed at once, and their positions are set to zero, indicating an empty cell.
Once candies are crushed, gravity comes into play. Any candies above the empty cells will fall down to fill the empty spaces.
New candies do not enter the board from the top. Only existing candies drop down.
The crushing and dropping process continues until no more crushing can occurâ€”i.e., no groups of three or more adjacent candies of the same type are left.
The goal is to keep applying these rules until the board reaches a stable state with no more possible crushes. The final stable board should be returned. */
