## 📌 Problem 1: Largest Two-Digit Divisor with Remainder 1

### **Question**

Find the largest two-digit number that divides both 673 and 865, leaving a remainder of 1 in each case.

### **Solution**

Let the required number be $d$. According to the problem:

* $673 \equiv 1 \pmod{d} \Rightarrow d \mid (673 - 1) = 672$
* $865 \equiv 1 \pmod{d} \Rightarrow d \mid (865 - 1) = 864$

Thus, $d$ must divide both 672 and 864. So we need:

$$
d = \gcd(672, 864)
$$

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. $$
   $$

864 \div 672 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} = 192
]
2\. $672 \div 192 = 3 \quad \text{remainder} = 96$
3\. $192 \div 96 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} = 0$

Therefore:

$$
\gcd(672, 864) = 96
$$

### ✅ **Answer:** $\boxed{96}$

## 📌 Problem 2: Evaluate the Arithmetic Expression

### **Question**

Evaluate the expression:

$$
5 \times \frac{(2 + 16)}{2} - 4 \times (2 + 2) + \frac{1}{4} \times 16
$$

### **Solution**

Simplify step-by-step:

1. Inside the parentheses:

   $$
   2 + 16 = 18, \quad 2 + 2 = 4
   $$

2. Update the expression:

   $$
   5 \times \frac{18}{2} - 4 \times 4 + \frac{1}{4} \times 16
   $$

3. Calculate:

   $$
   5 \times 9 = 45
   $$

   $$
   4 \times 4 = 16
   $$

   $$
   \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
   $$

4. Combine:

   $$
   45 - 16 + 4 = 33
   $$

### ✅ **Answer:** $\boxed{33}$

## 📌 Problem 3: Finding the Rate of Interest

### **Question**

If the simple interest earned on a sum of money in 15 years is twice the amount invested, what is the annual rate of interest?

### **Solution**

Use the formula for Simple Interest:

$$
\text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

Given:

* $\text{SI} = 2P$
* $T = 15$
* $R = ?$

Substitute into the formula:

$$
2P = \frac{P \times R \times 15}{100}
$$

Cancel $P$ from both sides (assuming $P \neq 0$):

$$
2 = \frac{R \times 15}{100}
$$

Solve for $R$:

$$
2 \times 100 = 15R \Rightarrow 200 = 15R \Rightarrow R = \frac{200}{15} = 13.33\%
$$

### ✅ **Answer:** $\boxed{13.33\%}$

### 🧠 **Problem 4: Work and Time**

**Problem:**
If 6 men can complete a job in 12 days, how many days will it take for 8 men to complete the same job, assuming they work at the same rate?

---

### 📘 Step 1: Understand the concept

This is a classic **work and time** problem. The total work (W) remains the same. We use the formula:

$$
\text{Work} = \text{Number of men} \times \text{Days}
$$

Let:

* 6 men working for 12 days = total work = $6 \times 12 = 72$ man-days
* We want to know how many days (D) it will take for 8 men to do the same 72 man-days of work.

---

### 📘 Step 2: Set up the equation

Let $D$ be the required number of days:

$$
8 \times D = 72
$$

---

### 📘 Step 3: Solve for $D$

$$
D = \frac{72}{8} = 9
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9} \ \text{days}
$$

The head of a moving head disk with 100 tracks numbered from 0 to 99 is currently serving a request at track 50. The queue of requests kept in the First Come, First Served order is 10, 60, 70, 40, 80. What will be the total head movement for these requests?

Options

150

160

170

180

To calculate the total head movement, follow the sequence of track requests in the order they are served:

1. **Current Track:** 50
2. **Queue of Requests:** 10, 60, 70, 40, 80

- Move from track 50 to 10: \( |50 - 10| = 40 \)
- Move from track 10 to 60: \( |10 - 60| = 50 \)
- Move from track 60 to 70: \( |60 - 70| = 10 \)
- Move from track 70 to 40: \( |70 - 40| = 30 \)
- Move from track 40 to 80: \( |40 - 80| = 40 \)

Total head movement = \( 40 + 50 + 10 + 30 + 40 = 170 \)

So, the correct option is:

**170**

Code A has to execute 4*n²+ 64 program statements, while Code B has to execute 32*n program statements for a problem of size "n". The time to execute a single program statement is the same for all the statements. A programmer was given a problem with a certain size "k" and he used Code A. What can be the possible value of "k"?

1000

5

10

3

To determine the possible value of \( k \) for which the execution time of Code A and Code B are the same, set the number of statements executed by both codes equal:

For Code A: \( 4k^2 + 64 \)  
For Code B: \( 32k \)

Equate the two expressions:

\[ 4k^2 + 64 = 32k \]

Rearrange the equation:

\[ 4k^2 - 32k + 64 = 0 \]

Divide through by 4:

\[ k^2 - 8k + 16 = 0 \]

This factors to:

\[ (k - 4)^2 = 0 \]

So:

\[ k - 4 = 0 \]

Thus:

\[ k = 4 \]

Since 4 is not among the given options, it seems that none of the given options (1000, 5, 10, 3) will make the execution time of both codes the same. 

Therefore, based on the options provided and the calculated result, none of the values (1000, 5, 10, 3) are correct.

What will be the output of the following JavaScript code?

Options

var str = "";

var emp {empname: "Harris", place: "Houston", empID:101);

Harris Houston 101

var x = emp;

x.empname "Liza";

emp.empID=202;

for (y in emp)

{

Liza Houston 101

str += emp[y] + "";

Liza Houston 202

}

document.write(str);

Harris Houston 202

The provided JavaScript code has a syntax error and cannot execute as written. However, if we correct the syntax and assume the intended code is:

```javascript
var str = "";
var emp = { empname: "Harris", place: "Houston", empID: 101 };

var x = emp;
x.empname = "Liza";
emp.empID = 202;

for (var y in emp) {
    str += emp[y] + " ";
}

document.write(str);
```

Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. `var emp = { empname: "Harris", place: "Houston", empID: 101 };` creates an object `emp`.
2. `var x = emp;` assigns `x` to refer to the same object as `emp`.
3. `x.empname = "Liza";` changes the `empname` property to "Liza" in the shared object.
4. `emp.empID = 202;` updates the `empID` property to 202 in the shared object.
5. The `for` loop iterates over each property of the `emp` object and concatenates its values to `str`.

After the loop, `str` will contain the values of the properties in the `emp` object, which are now "Liza", "Houston", and "202".

So, the output of the code is:

**Liza Houston 202**

A programmer writes a program to find an element in the array A[5] with the elements: 8 30 40-45 70. The program is run to find a number "X", that is found in the first iteration of binary search. What is the value of "X"?

Options

40

8

70

30

To find the value of "X" that is found in the first iteration of binary search, we need to understand how binary search works. Binary search operates on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Given the array is sorted: \[8, 30, 40, 45, 70\]

1. **Initial step**: The middle element of the array is found. For an array of 5 elements, the middle index is \((0 + 4) / 2 = 2\).

2. **First iteration**: The middle element is at index 2, which is `40`.

Therefore, the value of "X" that is found in the first iteration of binary search is:

**40**

node value,

node right,

node-left.

A programmer writes the given function to do a preorder traversal of the tree.

What are Condition X and Condition Y?

OPTIONS

Condition X: node left isnotequal

Condition Y: node right isnotequal


In a preorder traversal of a binary tree, the function should visit the root node first, then recursively visit the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. To achieve this, the conditions for traversing the left and right children should check whether the children exist.

Given the context and the statements provided:

- `node-left` should be checked to ensure it is not `null` (or not equal to `null` or `undefined`).
- Similarly, `node-right` should be checked to ensure it is not `null` (or not equal to `null` or `undefined`).

Thus, the correct conditions are:

**Condition X: node-left is not null**  
**Condition Y: node-right is not null**

A company offers a commission of $5 to its salespersons for each product that they sell. However, if the salesperson sells more than 200 products, he gets a commission of $10 on all the products he sold after the first 200. The program to calculate the commission for a salesperson is given below.

commission (number Products 200) 10

integer numberProducts, commission input numberProducts

commission 2005+ (numberProducts 200) 10

if (numberProducts>200) MISSING STATEMENT else commission number Products 5 end if

commission number Products 10

print commission

Which statement to be inserted in missing statement 

Options

commission = (numberProducts - 200) * 10

commission = 200*5+ (numberProducts 200) * 10

commission numberProducts * 10

None of the above

To calculate the commission correctly based on the given conditions:

- For the first 200 products, the commission is $5 per product.
- For each product sold beyond 200, the commission is $10 per product.

When the number of products sold is greater than 200, the commission should be calculated as follows:

1. The commission for the first 200 products is \(200 \times 5 = 1000\).
2. The commission for products beyond 200 is \((\text{numberProducts} - 200) \times 10\).

So the formula to compute the total commission should be:

**commission = 200 \times 5 + (numberProducts - 200) \times 10**

Thus, the correct statement to insert in the missing part of the program is:

**commission = 200*5 + (numberProducts - 200) * 10**
