Recursion can be quite confusing at first, but understanding the order of operations (base case, recursive call, and processing) is key. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### General Pattern of Recursion:

1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely.
2. **Recursive Call**: The function calls itself with a modified argument that gradually moves towards the base case.
3. **Processing**: Depending on the problem, processing can be done before or after the recursive call.

### Two Common Patterns:

1. **Base Case → Processing → Recursive Call**:

   - Process the current state before making the recursive call.
   - This pattern is used when you need to accumulate results or do some work before diving deeper into recursion.

   Example:

   ```java
   public void printNumbers(int n) {
       if (n == 0) {
           return; // Base case
       }
       System.out.println(n); // Processing before recursive call
       printNumbers(n - 1); // Recursive call
   }
   ```
2. **Base Case → Recursive Call → Processing**:

   - Make the recursive call first and then process the result.
   - This pattern is used when you need to gather results from deeper recursive calls or when processing depends on the results of those calls.

   Example:

   ```java
   public void printNumbers(int n) {
       if (n == 0) {
           return; // Base case
       }
       printNumbers(n - 1); // Recursive call
       System.out.println(n); // Processing after recursive call
   }
   ```

### Example with `countAndSay`:

Let's look at the `countAndSay` problem to understand the flow.

1. **Base Case**: When `n` is 1, return "1".
2. **Recursive Call**: Call `countAndSay(n - 1)` to get the previous sequence.
3. **Processing**: Process the previous sequence to generate the current sequence.

Here’s the detailed flow:

1. **Base Case**: When `n` is 1, return "1".
2. **Recursive Call**: For `n = 4`, the call stack looks like this:
   - `countAndSay(4)`
     - `countAndSay(3)`
       - `countAndSay(2)`
         - `countAndSay(1)` returns "1".
3. **Processing**:
   - `countAndSay(2)` processes "1" to produce "11".
   - `countAndSay(3)` processes "11" to produce "21".
   - `countAndSay(4)` processes "21" to produce "1211".

In the case of `countAndSay`, the pattern is:
**Base Case → Recursive Call → Processing**.

### Java Code with Explanation:

```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return "1"; // Base case
        }

        String say = countAndSay(n - 1); // Recursive call

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < say.length(); i++) { // Processing
            int count = 1;
            char ch = say.charAt(i);

            while (i < say.length() - 1 && say.charAt(i) == say.charAt(i + 1)) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }

            result.append(count).append(ch);
        }

        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.countAndSay(4)); // Example usage, expecting "1211" for n=4
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Java Code:

1. **Base Case**: If `n == 1`, return "1".
2. **Recursive Call**: Call `countAndSay(n - 1)` to get the sequence for `n - 1`.
3. **Processing**:
   - Create an empty `StringBuilder` for the result.
   - Iterate over the characters in the previous sequence.
   - Count consecutive characters and append the count followed by the character to the result.

By following these steps, the recursion unwinds, processing each level based on the result of the deeper level, ultimately building up to the final result for the original `n`.
