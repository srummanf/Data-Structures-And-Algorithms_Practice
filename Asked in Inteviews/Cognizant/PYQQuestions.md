# Sample Question Set for Cognizant


## **Q1: Isabelle's Twins' Age Problem**

**Question:**
Isabelle gave birth to twins at age 23. After `m` years, the sum of their ages was 47. Find `m`.

**Solution:**
Isabelle's age after $m$ years:

$$
23 + m
$$

Twins' age after $m$ years:

$$
m + m = 2m
$$

Total age:

$$
23 + m + 2m = 47 \Rightarrow 23 + 3m = 47
$$

$$
3m = 24 \Rightarrow m = 8
$$

**✅ Answer:** $\boxed{8 \text{ years}}$

## **Q2: Supplementary and Complementary Angles**

**Question:**
If the sum of the supplementary angle and twice the complementary angle is $270^\circ$, find the angle.

**Solution:**
Let the angle be $x^\circ$.

* Supplementary: $180 - x$
* Complementary: $90 - x$

Given:

$$
(180 - x) + 2(90 - x) = 270
$$

$$
180 - x + 180 - 2x = 270 \Rightarrow 360 - 3x = 270
$$

$$
3x = 90 \Rightarrow x = 30
$$

**✅ Answer:** $\boxed{30^\circ}$

## **Q3: Trains Meeting Problem**

**Question:**
Two trains 300 km apart move toward each other. A at 40 km/h, B at 60 km/h. After 2 hours, A increases by 10 km/h and B decreases by 15 km/h. When will they meet?

**Solution:**

Distance covered in 2 hours:

* Train A: $40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ km}$
* Train B: $60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ km}$

Remaining distance:

$$
300 - (80 + 120) = 100 \text{ km}
$$

New speeds:

* A: $40 + 10 = 50 \text{ km/h}$
* B: $60 - 15 = 45 \text{ km/h}$

Combined speed = $50 + 45 = 95 \text{ km/h}$

Time to meet:

$$
\frac{100}{95} \approx 1.05 \text{ hours}
$$

Total time:

$$
2 + 1.05 \approx \boxed{3.05 \text{ hours (or 3 hr 3 min)}}
$$

## **Q4: Merchant Profit/Loss**

**Question:**
Items A and B: CP of A = 40, B = 60. A sold at 25% profit, B at 10% loss. Sold: 10 A’s, 15 B’s. Find overall profit/loss percentage.

**Solution:**

* SP of A = $40 + 25\% = 50$
* SP of B = $60 - 10\% = 54$

Total:

* CP = $10 \times 40 + 15 \times 60 = 400 + 900 = 1300$
* SP = $10 \times 50 + 15 \times 54 = 500 + 810 = 1310$

Profit = $1310 - 1300 = 10$

Profit %:

$$
\frac{10}{1300} \times 100 \approx \boxed{0.77\%}
$$

## **Q5: Potatoes in Baskets**

**Question:**
Total = 120 kg. Ratio 1st:2nd = 3:4, and 2nd:3rd = 7:9. Find 2nd type quantity.

**Solution:**

Let:

* 1st = $3x$
* 2nd = $4x$
* From $4x = 7y \Rightarrow y = \frac{4x}{7}$
* 3rd = $9y = 9 \times \frac{4x}{7} = \frac{36x}{7}$

Total:

$$
3x + 4x + \frac{36x}{7} = 120 \Rightarrow \frac{85x}{7} = 120
\Rightarrow x = \frac{840}{85} \approx 9.88
$$

Quantity of 2nd:

$$
4x \approx 4 \times 9.88 = \boxed{39.52 \text{ kg}}
$$

## **Q6: Machine Work**

**Question:**
X produces 500 units in 10 hrs, Y produces 300 in 8 hrs. X & Y work 4 hrs together, then only Y works. Find extra time Y takes to produce 500 units total.

**Solution:**

Rates:

* X = 50 units/hr
* Y = 37.5 units/hr

Together for 4 hours:

$$
(50 + 37.5) \times 4 = 87.5 \times 4 = 350 \text{ units}
$$

Remaining = $500 - 350 = 150$

Time for Y:

$$
\frac{150}{37.5} = \boxed{4 \text{ hours}}
$$

## **Q7: Bookshelf Dimensions**

**Question:**
Length = 3 m more than twice breadth, perimeter = 24 m. Find breadth.

**Solution:**

Let breadth = $b$

Length = $2b + 3$

Perimeter:

$$
2(b + 2b + 3) = 24 \Rightarrow 2(3b + 3) = 24
\Rightarrow 3b + 3 = 12 \Rightarrow b = \boxed{3 \text{ meters}}
$$

## **Q8: Bicycle Travel Time**

**Question:**
Train: 540 km in 9 hrs → speed = 60 km/h
Bicycle: 24 km more than train’s distance at 12 km/h less.

**Solution:**

Bicycle speed = $60 - 12 = 48 \text{ km/h}$

Distance = $540 + 24 = 564 \text{ km}$

Time:

$$
\frac{564}{48} = \boxed{11.75 \text{ hours (or 11 hr 45 min)}}
$$

---

## **Q9: Drone Battery Range**

**Question:**
Original range = 100 miles
Increased by 20% → decreased by 5% of new

**Solution:**

New = $100 + 20\% = 120$

Reduction = $5\% \text{ of } 120 = 6$

Final range = $120 - 6 = \boxed{114 \text{ miles}}$

---

## **Q15: Laptop Profit %**

**Question:**
Bought at \$150, sold at \$220.

**Solution:**

$$
\text{Profit} = 220 - 150 = 70
\Rightarrow \text{Profit \%} = \frac{70}{150} \times 100 = \boxed{46.67\%}
$$

---

## **Q16: Sports Probability**

**Question:**
In a class of 30:

* 12 play basketball
* 8 play soccer
* 4 play both

Only one sport:

* Basketball only = $12 - 4 = 8$
* Soccer only = $8 - 4 = 4$

Total = $8 + 4 = 12$

Probability:

$$
\frac{12}{30} = \boxed{0.4 = 40\%}
$$

---

## **Q17: DPI Sensitivity**

**DPI Flow:**

* Initial = 1200
* Increased to 1500 → then decreased 10%
* Final = $1500 - 10\% = 1350$

**Answer:** Final DPI = \boxed{1350}
Increase: $\boxed{25\%}$, Decrease: $\boxed{10\%}$

---

## **Q18: Salary Increases**

**Given:**

* A\:B\:C = 7:9:12 → Total = 28x
* Increases: 20%, 15%, 10%

Total increase:

$$
7x \times 0.2 + 9x \times 0.15 + 12x \times 0.1 = 1.4x + 1.35x + 1.2x = 3.95x
$$

Given increase = \$6000 → $x = \frac{6000}{3.95} = 1519$

Original salaries = $$28x = 28 \times 1519 = \boxed{\$42,532}$$

---

## **Q19: Committee Selection**

From 7 men, 5 women — choose 4 people with at least 2 women.

**Case-wise:**

* 2W + 2M: $\binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{2} = 10 \cdot 21 = 210$
* 3W + 1M: $\binom{5}{3} \cdot \binom{7}{1} = 10 \cdot 7 = 70$
* 4W: $\binom{5}{4} = 5$

Total = $210 + 70 + 5 = \boxed{285}$

## **Q21: Cyclists Meeting**

Distance = 150 km, X is 20 km/h faster. Meet in 2 hours.

Let Y's speed = $v$

$$
2v + 2(v + 20) = 150 \Rightarrow 4v + 40 = 150
\Rightarrow v = 27.5 \Rightarrow \boxed{X = 47.5 \text{ km/h}}
$$

---

## **Q22: Paper Design Change**

Old: 15 pieces at 8%
New: 20 pieces at 5%

* Piece count ↑:

$$
\frac{5}{15} \times 100 = \boxed{33.33\%}
$$

* Piece size ↓:

$$
\frac{3}{8} \times 100 = \boxed{37.5\%}
$$

---

## **Q26: Truck Round Trip**

To & Fro: 60 km/h, 90 km/h; Total time = 10 hrs
Let distance = $d$

$$
\frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 10
\Rightarrow \frac{5d}{180} = 10 \Rightarrow d = \boxed{360 \text{ km}}
$$

---

## **Q27: Project Assignment**

8 projects → 4 teams, each gets ≥1 project.

Use:

$$
S(8, 4) \times 4! = 1701 \times 24 = \boxed{40,824}
$$

---

## **Q28: Keyboard Keys**

100 keys:

* 30% function = 30
* 25% macro = 25
  Regular = $100 - 55 = \boxed{45 \text{ keys}}$

---

### ✅ Q29: Profit Margins

**Given:**

* January: Sales = 30,000, Expenses = 20,000 → Profit = 10,000

$$
\text{Margin} = \frac{10000}{30000} \times 100 = \boxed{33.33\%}
$$

* June: Sales = 35,000, Expenses = 21,000 → Profit = 14,000

$$
\text{Margin} = \frac{14000}{35000} \times 100 = \boxed{40\%}
$$

---

### ✅ Q30: Mixed Profit

**Problem:**
200 items at \$20. Some sold at 20% profit, rest at 10% loss. Total profit = 59%. How many items were sold at profit?

Let $x$ items be sold at 20% profit:

$$
\text{Total CP} = 200 \times 20 = 4000
$$

$$
\text{Total SP} = 24x + (3600 - 18x) = 3600 + 6x
$$

$$
\text{Given profit: } 4000 \times 1.59 = 6360
$$

$$
3600 + 6x = 6360 \Rightarrow x = \frac{2760}{6} = \boxed{460}
$$
