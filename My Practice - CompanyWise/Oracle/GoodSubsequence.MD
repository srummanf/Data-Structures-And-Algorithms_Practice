### Problem Context

You are trying to determine the number of **good subsequences** in a given string. A good subsequence is one where each character in the subsequence appears the same number of times.

### Code Explanation

The given code snippet counts the number of good subsequences by iterating through possible lengths of subsequences (`i`) and using combinations to calculate the number of valid subsequences of that length.

### Key Variables:

- **`characterCount[j]`**: The frequency of the j-th character in the string.
- **`maxCount`**: The maximum frequency of any character in the string.
- **`countForLength`**: The number of good subsequences of a particular length `i`.
- **`MOD`**: The modulo value \(10^9 + 7\), used to keep the answer within manageable limits.

### Explanation of `+1` and `-1`

1. **`+1` in the Calculation**:

   - **Purpose**: To account for the case where a character does not appear in the subsequence.
   - **Explanation**: When you are calculating the number of ways to pick `i` characters from `characterCount[j]`, the combination function `combination(characterCount[j], i)` gives you the number of ways to pick `i` characters. By adding `1`, you account for the possibility of not picking that character at all in the subsequence.
   - **Mathematically**: \( (combination(characterCount[j], i) + 1) \) represents both the choices of selecting exactly `i` occurrences and not selecting that character (which is valid in the construction of subsequences).
2. **`-1` in the Calculation**:

   - **Purpose**: To exclude the empty subsequence from the count.
   - **Explanation**: When you calculate `countForLength`, it includes the empty subsequence (where no characters are selected from any of the 26 letters). However, the problem states that an empty subsequence is not a good subsequence, so you subtract 1 to remove it from the final count.
   - **Mathematically**: The formula `countForLength - 1` adjusts the count to exclude the empty subsequence.

### Code Flow Summary:

1. **Outer Loop** (`i = 1` to `maxCount`):

   - Iterates through each possible subsequence length.
2. **Inner Loop** (`j = 0` to `25`):

   - For each character in the alphabet, it computes the contribution to subsequences of length `i`.
3. **`countForLength` Calculation**:

   - Computes the total number of subsequences of length `i` using the combination formula and includes cases where characters might not appear at all (hence `+1`).
4. **Adjust for Empty Subsequence**:

   - Subtracts 1 to ensure the empty subsequence is not counted.
5. **Update Answer**:

   - The result for subsequences of length `i` is added to the total answer.

### Example (String "abca"):

For the string "abca":

- **Character counts**: 'a' appears 2 times, 'b' and 'c' appear once each.
- **maxCount**: 2 (since 'a' appears the most, 2 times).

The loops will calculate the number of valid subsequences, ensuring that subsequences like "aba" or "aca" are counted correctly, excluding the empty subsequence.

### Conclusion

The `+1` accounts for the option of not selecting a character in the subsequence, and the `-1` removes the empty subsequence from the final count. This ensures that only non-empty, valid "good" subsequences are considered.
