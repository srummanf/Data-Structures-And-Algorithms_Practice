# Computer Networks Revision Notes

## Overview

Computer Networks enable the exchange of data between devices using various technologies and protocols. Key components include network topologies, models, protocols, and algorithms for efficient data transmission and routing.

## Topology

- **Bus Topology**: Single central cable, all devices connected. Simple but prone to collisions.
- **Star Topology**: Devices connected to a central hub. Easy to manage but single point of failure.
- **Ring Topology**: Each device connected to two others, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction, but a failure in any cable can disrupt the network.
- **Mesh Topology**: Devices interconnected. Provides high redundancy but is complex to install.
- **Hybrid Topology**: Combination of two or more different topologies.

## OSI Model

Divides network communication into seven layers, each with specific functions.

| Layer           | Function                             | Protocols and Devices |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 7. Application  | End-user services                    | HTTP, FTP, SMTP       |
| 6. Presentation | Data translation and encryption      | SSL, JPEG             |
| 5. Session      | Session management                   | NetBIOS, PPTP         |
| 4. Transport    | Reliable data transfer               | TCP, UDP              |
| 3. Network      | Path determination and IP addressing | IP, ICMP, Routers     |
| 2. Data Link    | Node-to-node data transfer           | Ethernet, Switches    |
| 1. Physical     | Physical connection                  | Cables, Hubs          |

## TCP/IP Model

A simplified, four-layer model.

- **Application Layer**: Handles high-level protocols, issues of representation, encoding, and dialog control.
- **Transport Layer**: Ensures error-free data transmission between hosts.
- **Internet Layer**: Manages logical addressing and routing.
- **Network Access Layer**: Deals with hardware addressing and physical transmission.

## OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

- **Purpose**: A link-state routing protocol used to find the best path for data through a network.
- **Features**:
  - Uses Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation.
  - Hierarchical design: Divides large networks into areas.
  - Fast convergence and scalability.
  - Supports CIDR and VLSM.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

- **Use**: Calculates the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize distances: Set source node distance to 0, all others to infinity.
  2. Mark all nodes unvisited. Set initial node as current.
  3. For the current node, consider all unvisited neighbors. Calculate their tentative distances.
  4. When all neighbors are visited, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.
  5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node.
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all nodes are visited.

## Routing

- **Static Routing**: Manually configured routes. Simple but not scalable.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses protocols to automatically update routing tables.
  - **RIP**: Uses hop count as a metric, simple but inefficient for large networks.
  - **OSPF**: Link-state protocol, efficient, and suitable for large networks.
  - **BGP**: Used for routing between autonomous systems on the internet.

## Class and Classless Addressing

- **Classful Addressing**:

  - **Class A**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0, /8 subnet mask.
  - **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0, /16 subnet mask.
  - **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0, /24 subnet mask.
- **Classless Addressing (CIDR)**:

  - Allows for variable-length subnet masking.
  - More efficient use of IP addresses.

## Subnet Masking

- **Purpose**: Divides an IP address into network and host portions.
- **Example**:
  - IP Address: 192.168.1.1
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
  - Network Address: 192.168.1.0
  - Host Range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254
  - Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255

# Chapter 4 : Medium Access Sublayers

### Two Sublayers

1. **Logical Link Control (LLC)** (TOP) and **Media Access Control (MAC)** (BOTTOM):

   - IEEE has subdivided the data-link layer into these two sublayers.
2. **Media Access Control (MAC)**:

   - Defines the specific access method for each LAN (e.g., Ethernet).

  - \( TT = Packet length/Transmission rate or Bandwidth )
- ![1721840796838](image/CN/1721840796838.png)

## Summary

### Data-Link Layer in Networking

The Data-Link Layer is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between devices on the same network. It ensures that data is sent correctly and efficiently. This layer is divided into two parts:

1. **Logical Link Control (LLC) (TOP)**
2. **Media Access Control (MAC) (BOTTOM)**

#### 1. **Media Access Control (MAC)**

**What It Does:**

- **Access Method:** Determines how devices on a network share and access the network medium (e.g., wires or airwaves). For example, it specifies rules for how multiple devices can use the same Ethernet cable without interfering with each other.
- **Addressing:** Handles addressing so that data sent across the network reaches the correct device. Each device has a unique MAC address.

**Think of it like this:**

- If you’re in a classroom with a shared whiteboard, the MAC layer is like the rulebook for who gets to write on the board and when. It also makes sure that each person’s writing is identified correctly.

#### 2. **Logical Link Control (LLC)**

**What It Does:**

- **Flow Control:** Manages the rate at which data is sent to ensure that the receiving device isn't overwhelmed.
- **Error Control:** Detects and corrects errors that may occur during data transmission.
- **Framing Duties:** Helps in organizing data into frames (packets) so that it can be correctly understood by the receiving device.

**Think of it like this:**

- Using the same classroom example, the LLC layer is like a teacher who ensures that everyone is writing neatly and correctly on the whiteboard, checking for mistakes, and making sure that everyone writes at a pace that’s manageable.

### Framing

**What It Is:**

- **Framing:** The process of packaging data into frames or packets for transmission. Both the MAC and LLC layers are involved in this process.

**Think of it like this:**

- Imagine you’re sending a letter. The framing process is like putting the letter into an envelope and addressing it. The MAC layer decides who the envelope is addressed to, while the LLC layer makes sure the letter is written correctly and fits neatly into the envelope.

### Summary

- **MAC Layer (BOTTOM):** Deals with how devices access the network and their unique addresses.
- **LLC Layer (TOP):** Manages how data is sent and received, checking for errors and ensuring data flows smoothly.

By dividing these tasks, the Data-Link Layer ensures that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently across the network.

## Random Access

1. **Characteristics**:

   - No station is superior or controls another.
   - Stations do not have assigned times to transmit; transmissions are random.
   - No rules dictate which station should send next, leading to contention and possible collisions.
2. **Collision Handling**:

   - If more than one station transmits simultaneously, a collision occurs, destroying or modifying frames.
   - Protocols answer key questions regarding medium access, busy medium, transmission success or failure, and conflict resolution.

## ALOHA

- **Pure ALOHA**:

  - Developed at the University of Hawaii around 1970.
  - Designed for a radio LAN but applicable to any shared medium.
  - Each station sends a frame whenever it has one, leading to possible collisions.
  - Vulnerable time for collision is ![1721841082223](image/CN/1721841082223.png)
  - ![1721841184213](image/CN/1721841184213.png)
  - ![1721841281365](image/CN/1721841281365.png)
- **Collision Handling**:

  - Stations wait a random back-off time \( (T_B) \) after a time-out before resending frames to avoid collisions.
  - After a maximum number of retransmission attempts \( (K_{max}) \), stations must give up and try later.
- ### Throughput in Pure ALOHA

  **Definition:**
  Throughput in Pure ALOHA is the fraction of the total available bandwidth that is effectively used for successful data transmission. Pure ALOHA is a simple network protocol where data collisions can occur due to simultaneous transmissions by multiple devices. The throughput measures how efficiently the network is used despite these collisions.

  **Formula:**

| **Metric**         | **Description**                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Throughput (S)** | The fraction of successful transmissions.  |
| **Formula**        | ![1721841452220](image/CN/1721841452220.png) |

- **\( S \):** Throughput
- **\( G \):** Average number of frames generated by the system in one frame time
- **\( e \):** Base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718)

### Summary

- **Pure ALOHA Throughput Formula:** ![1721841403145](image/CN/1721841403145.png)
- **Optimal Throughput:** The maximum throughput for Pure ALOHA is ![1721841427258](image/CN/1721841427258.png) or approximately 18.4% when \( G = 0.5 \).

| **1000 frames/second**    | 1 ms                                      | \( G = 1000 * 0.001 = 1 \)      | \( S = 1 * e^{-2 \times 1} \)                  | 0.135 (13.5%)            | 135                                                 |
| **500 frames/second**     | 1 ms                                      | \( G = 500 * 0.001 = 0.5 \)    | \( S = 0.5 * e^{-2 \times 0.5} \)               | 0.184 (18.4%)            | 92                                                  |
| **250 frames/second**     | 1 ms                                      | \( G = 250 * 0.001 = 0.25 \)    | \( S = 0.25 * e^{-2 \times 0.25} \)             | 0.152 (15.2%)            | 38                                                  |

  - Time divided into slots of \( Tfr \).
  - Stations send only at the beginning of a time slot.
  - Reduces vulnerable time to \( Tfr \).
  - ![1721841860920](image/CN/1721841860920.png)
- **Efficiency**:

  - Slotted ALOHA: ~37%

### Comparison: Pure ALOHA vs. Slotted ALOHA

| Aspect             | Pure ALOHA                                   | Slotted ALOHA                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Time Structure     | No specific structure; data sent at any time | Data sent at the beginning of time slots          |
| Efficiency         | ~18.4%                                       | ~37%                                              |
| Collision Handling | Resend after a random interval               | Send at time slot beginnings, reducing collisions |
| Complexity         | Less complex, no synchronization             | More complex, requires synchronization            |

## Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)

### Overview

- **Purpose**: Minimize collision chance and increase performance by sensing the medium before transmission.
- **Mechanism**: Each station listens to the medium before sending, known as "sense before transmit" or "listen before talk."
- **Limitation**: Collisions cannot be entirely eliminated due to propagation delay.

### Vulnerable Time

- **Definition**: The vulnerable time for CSMA is the propagation time \( Tp \).
- **Scenario**: If a station sends a frame and another station sends a frame during this time, a collision occurs.
- **Resolution**: If the first bit of the frame reaches the end of the medium, all stations will refrain from sending.

### Persistence Methods

1. **1-Persistent Method**

   - A station sends its frame immediately upon finding the line idle.
   - **Risk**: High chance of collision if multiple stations find the line idle simultaneously.
2. **Nonpersistent Method**

   - A station senses the line and waits a random amount of time if the line is busy before retrying.
   - **Advantage**: Reduces collision chances.
   - **Disadvantage**: Decreases network efficiency due to idle medium.
3. **P-Persistent Method**

   - A station sends its frame with probability \( p \) if the line is idle.
   - **Process**:
     - If the line is busy, it waits for the next time slot and checks again.
     - If the line remains idle, the station follows the same steps.
     - If a collision occurs, it uses the backoff procedure.
   - **Advantage**: Balances collision reduction and network efficiency.

## (CSMA/CD) - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection

### Mechanism

- **Post-Transmission Monitoring**: A station monitors the medium after sending a frame to check for collisions.
- **Collision Handling**: If a collision is detected, the station resends the frame.

### Requirements

- **Minimum Frame Size**: Ensures collision detection by requiring the frame transmission time \( T_{fr} \) to be at least twice the maximum propagation time \( T_p \).

### Energy Levels

- **Zero Level**: Channel is idle.
- **Normal Level**: A station is successfully sending a frame.
- **Abnormal Level**: Indicates a collision, with energy level twice the normal.

## (CSMA/CA) - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance

### Overview

- **Use Case**: Ideal for wireless networks where collisions cannot be easily detected.
- **Goal**: Avoid collisions through specific strategies.

### Strategies

1. **Interframe Space (IFS)**

   - Defers transmission even if the channel is idle by waiting for a period called IFS.
   - Allows the signal to reach distant stations and prioritizes stations or frame types.
2. **Contention Window**

   - Divides the waiting time into slots and selects a random number of slots as the wait time.
   - Uses binary exponential back-off strategy, doubling the number of slots each time.
   - Monitors the channel after each slot, resuming the timer when the channel is idle.
3. **Acknowledgment**

   - Ensures data integrity by using positive acknowledgment and time-out timers to confirm frame reception.

## Flow Control

- **Purpose**: Prevent data overflow by managing the buffer memory of the receiving device.
- **Mechanism**: The receiver communicates with the sender to adjust the transmission rate, ensuring smooth data flow and avoiding system overload.

# Error Control

- **Components**: Detection and retransmission of lost, out-of-order, or corrupt frames.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) process to detect errors and trigger retransmission, maintaining data integrity.

---

### Sliding Window Protocol

#### 1. Stop-and-Wait Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)

- **Error Handling**: When a frame is corrupted, it is silently discarded. The lack of an acknowledgment (ACK) indicates an error to the sender.
- **Retransmission**: The sender keeps a copy of the sent frame and starts a timer. If the timer expires without receiving an ACK, the frame is resent.
- **Sequence Numbers**: Frames are numbered using sequence numbers to differentiate between new and retransmitted frames. Only two numbers (0 and 1) are used to avoid confusion.

  **Delays**:

  - **Propagation Delay (Tp)**: Time taken for a bit to travel from sender to receiver.
  - **Transmission Delay (Tt)**: Time taken to put all bits of a frame on the transmission medium.
  - **Queuing Delay**: Time a packet waits in the input/output queue of a router.
  - **Processing Delay**: Time to process the packet at the destination.

  **Total Time Calculation**:

  - Total Time = Tt(data) + 2 * Tp
  - Efficiency (η) = 1 / (1 + 2 * Tp/Tt)
  - Throughput = η * Bandwidth (B)

#### 2. Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)

- **Efficiency**: Improves over Stop-and-Wait by allowing multiple frames to be sent before receiving acknowledgments.
- **Sliding Window**: Sender maintains a window of frames that can be sent without waiting for an ACK.

  - **Window Variables**:
    - Sf: First outstanding frame
    - Sn: Next frame to be sent
    - Ssize: Window size
- **Receiver**: Has a fixed window size of one and sends cumulative acknowledgments for correctly received frames.
- **Timers**: Single timer for the first outstanding frame. If it expires, all outstanding frames are resent.

  **Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers**:

  - Window Size (Ws) = (1 + 2a)
  - Number of bits for sequence numbers = ceil(log2(1 + 2a))

#### 3. Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)

- **Selective Resend**: Only the frames that are received incorrectly are resent, improving efficiency over Go-Back-N in unstable connections.
- **Receiver**: Can store out-of-order frames and acknowledges each correctly received frame.
- **Timers**: Each frame has its own timer.
- **Piggybacking**: Data frames can carry acknowledgment information for frames traveling in the opposite direction.

### Error Detection and Correction

#### Types of Errors

- **Single-bit Error**: Only one bit in the data unit changes.
- **Burst Error**: Two or more bits in the data unit change.

#### Hamming Distance

- **Definition**: Number of differing bits between two words.
- **Calculation**: XOR the two words and count the number of 1s in the result.

#### Simple Parity-Check Code

- **Parity Bit**: An additional bit ensuring an even or odd number of 1s.
- **Hamming Distance**: Minimum distance of 2, detects single-bit errors.

#### Two-Dimensional Parity Check

- **Table Arrangement**: Data arranged in a table with parity bits for rows and columns.
- **Error Detection**: Can detect up to three errors, may miss four or more errors.

#### Hamming Codes

- **Error-Correcting Codes**: Detect up to two errors or correct one error.
- **Parity Bits**: Placed at positions \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^n\).

#### Checksum

- **Addition Method**: Add all numbers, send the sum with the data.
- **Validation**: Receiver adds numbers and compares the sum.

#### One's Complement

- **Negative Representation**: Inverting all bits.
- **Checksum Validation**: Adding all numbers (including the checksum) should result in 0 if no errors.

#### Cyclic Codes

- **Property**: Cyclic shift of a codeword results in another codeword.

#### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

- **Process**: Dataword augmented with zeros, divided by a predefined divisor. Remainder appended to dataword.
- **Encoder/Decoder**: Uses polynomials to represent binary patterns.

  - **First Address:** Set the (32-n) rightmost bits to 0.
  - **Last Address:** Set the (32-n) rightmost bits to 1.

### Routing

- **Definition**: When a router receives an IP packet, it uses a routing table to decide the appropriate interface to send the packet to reach its destination.
- **Routing Table**: Contains information about the network and helps in deciding the interface for sending packets.
  - **Static Routing**: Manually entered routing information.
    - Pros: Simple, low overhead.
    - Cons: Not feasible for large, dynamic networks like the internet.

    - Pros: Adapts to changes in the network.
    - Cons: More complex, requires more resources.

### Flooding

- **Definition**: A method where a packet is sent to all possible paths instead of calculating the shortest path.
- **Advantages**:
  - No routing algorithm required.
  - Shortest path is guaranteed.
  - Highly reliable.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High traffic.
  - Duplicate packets may arrive at the destination and intermediate routers.

- **Interdomain Routing**: Routing between autonomous systems.
- **Autonomous System (AS)**: A group of networks and routers under a single administration.

### Distance Vector Routing

- **Definition**: Uses a vector (table) of minimum distances to every node to determine the least-cost route.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Sharing information between neighbors.
  - Nodes send their entire table to neighbors, who then decide what to use.
  - Periodic and triggered updates.

### Link State Routing

- **Definition**: Each node has the entire topology of the domain and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to build a routing table.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creation and dissemination of Link State Packets (LSP).
  - Formation of shortest path trees.
  - Calculation of routing tables based on shortest path trees.

### Difference between Distance Vector Routing (DVR) and Link State Routing (LSR)

- **DVR**:
  - Shares local knowledge.
  - Less bandwidth requirement.

  - Based on Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
  - Converges faster.
  - No count to infinity.
  - Example: OSPF.

### Split Horizon

- **Definition**: Prevents routing loops by not advertising a route back to the router from which it was learned.
- **Function**: Reduces routing confusion and helps stabilize the network.

### Building Routing Tables in Link State Routing

1. **Creation of LSPs**: Each node creates a packet representing the state of its links.
2. **Dissemination of LSPs**: LSPs are flooded throughout the network.
3. **Formation of Shortest Path Tree**: Each node uses Dijkstra's algorithm.
4. **Calculation of Routing Tables**: Based on the shortest path tree.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- **Process**:
  1. Nodes are divided into tentative and permanent sets.
  2. Neighbors of a current node are made tentative and examined.
  3. Nodes that pass criteria are made permanent.
  4. The cumulative cost from the root to each node is calculated.

### Count to Infinity Problem

- **Issue**: In distance-vector routing, broken links are not immediately recognized as infinity, leading to slow convergence.

# **Application Layer**

### **Electronic Mail (E-mail)**

- **Evolution:** Initially for text-based communication, now supports multimedia, multiple recipients, HTML, encryption, and integration with other services.
- **Message Transfer Agent (MTA):** Uses SMTP for sending emails between clients and servers.
- **Message Access Agent:** POP3 and IMAP4 for retrieving emails. POP3 downloads and optionally deletes emails, while IMAP4 supports server-side organization and partial downloads.
- **MIME:** Extends email to handle non-ASCII data (e.g., binary files, different languages).
- **Web-Based Mail:** Uses HTTP for accessing emails through web interfaces (e.g., Hotmail, Yahoo).

### **File Transfer**

- **FTP:** Protocol for transferring files using two connections (data and control). Port 21 for control and port 20 for data. Security issues require SSL for encryption (SSL-FTP).
- **TFTP:** Simple, UDP-based protocol for basic file transfers. Not secure or reliable for long-distance transfers.

### **World Wide Web (WWW)**

- **Architecture:** Distributed client-server model with web pages stored on servers and accessed via browsers.
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL):** Identifies web pages using protocol, host, port, and path.
- **Cookies:** Allow stateful interactions by storing user information on the client side.

### **HTTP**

- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** Retrieves web pages using TCP on port 80. Supports persistent and nonpersistent connections. HTTPS provides security by using SSL/TLS.

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

- **Function:** Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
- **Hierarchy:** Includes root name servers, top-level domain servers, and authoritative name servers.
- **Name Space:** Hierarchical with unique labels for each domain.

### **Telnet**

- **Protocol:** Text-based for remote server access on TCP port 23. Lacks encryption, making it less secure than alternatives like SSH.

### **ARPANET**

- **History:** Early packet-switched network that laid the groundwork for the Internet. Decommissioned in 1990.

### **X.25**

- **Protocol:** Old WAN protocol supporting error checking and virtual circuits. Replaced by faster technologies but influenced newer ones.

### **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)**

- **Usage:** Manages and monitors network devices. Operates over UDP, interacting with MIBs for device control. Scalable with various security features.
